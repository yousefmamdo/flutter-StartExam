## What is Flutter?

***Back in the days of Objective C/Swift and Java/Kotlin as primary languages for mobile development, building apps was expensive. You had to build two separate apps, which obviously meant doing the work twice.To solve this problem, several frameworks have been constructed for the creation of hybrid (or cross-platform) apps in HTML5 and Javascript. Among the cross-platform toolkits, including Phonegap, Xamarin, React Native, and more, the Flutter framework has quickly become increasingly popular among developers, enterprises, entrepreneurs and users.Flutter is a portable UI toolkit for building native-like apps across mobile, web and desktop, from a single codebase. It uses the programming language Dart and incorporates Material Design and Cupertino widgets. Flutter developers can create spectacular UI that looks and feels native. It behaves naturally on any platform, even though youâ€™re using one codebase.Flutter is the only framework with a mobile SDK that provides a responsive style without using a Javascript bridge, thereby reaching a level of performance that rivals its cousin and direct competitor React Native. It easily integrates with the different platforms such as Android, IOS and Linux, MAC, Windows and Google Fuchsia applications.***
